I have begun research into the process of uploading spherical videos to YouTube as a starting area. This has proven to be a great start as Google's documentation has offered some initial insight along with pointing to a GitHub Spatial Media repository. This repository includes links to other projects including a header injecting tool and standards for spherical audio and video. The resource links can be found below:
- [Upload process](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631)
- [Spatial Media repo](https://github.com/google/spatial-media/tree/v2.0)

I have started thinking about what to demo. One such option would be to go through the process of making my own spherical video and uploading it to YouTube. The trickiest part will be to find a camera that supports it, or some way to use footage from a camera I already have spliced with something else, like a stock 360 video or image of a movie theater.

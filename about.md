One of the requirements in the course CSC461 - Multimedia Systems at the University of Victoria is a project around surveying a multimedia system. The system chosen was spherical video. This site will be updated as I work on the project and remain up after it has been completed.

This site will hold the different deliverables and updates made during the course of the project. Along with these, a few articles that give an overview of spherical videos will be posted as well based on research done for the project.
